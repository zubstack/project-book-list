# Capstone Project: Book Notes

## Instructions

### What are Capstone Projects?

Capstone Projects are comprehensive assignments that serve as a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout a course. This capstone project focuses on integrating public APIs into web projects, utilizing Express/Node.js for server-side programming, and demonstrating proficiency in CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database.

## Overview

After finishing reading books, it's common to forget essential details. To address this, the capstone project revolves around note-taking. Inspired by Derek Sivers' website, where he catalogs non-fiction books, this project aims to create a similar platform. Users can store and manage information about books they've read, incorporating features like sorting by rating and recency.

## Objectives

- Revise how to integrate public APIs into web projects.

- Gain more experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

- Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.

## Example Ideas

- Use the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers.

- Create a database to store books you have read.

- Have a way to add new data about books, update previous reviews and delete entries.

- Display this information from your database in a website like https://sive.rs/book

- Be able to sort your book entries by rating and recency.

## Requirements

1. **Database Persistence**

   - Utilize a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
   - Implement CRUD methods to manipulate data.

2. **Project Planning**

   - Research API documentation and plan project features.
   - Develop a database diagram on draw.io, considering relationships.
   - Outline PostgreSQL commands for schema creation.

3. **Project Setup**

   - Initiate a new Node.js project using Express.js.
   - Include pg for PostgreSQL database interaction.
   - Employ EJS for templating.
   - Develop a structured directory and file organization.
   - Create frontend using HTML, CSS, and JS.

4. **API Integration**

   - Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with the Open Library Covers API.
   - Use Axios for HTTP requests and response handling.

5. **Data Presentation**

   - Design the application to display book covers from the API and database data in a user-friendly manner.
   - Utilize HTML, CSS, and EJS for templating.
   - Implement user-friendly sorting options for database data.

6. **Error Handling**

   - Ensure robust error handling for both application and API requests.
   - Provide user-relevant errors and log errors to the console.

7. **Documentation**

   - Include comments throughout the code to explain logic.

8. **Code Sharing**
   - Utilize GitHub for version control.
   - Share the project on GitHub for collaboration and feedback.
   - Include a Readme.md file explaining how to start the server and run the code (e.g., `npm i` and then `nodemon index.js`).
