    Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in any
    situation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read classic from
    1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren’t enough because the
    little book is filled with so many memorable stories — examples of great
    day-to-day moments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when you
    need them. (I especially loved the one about the power of the prisoner in
    solitary confinement.) So go buy and read the book. I’m giving it a 10/10
    rating even though the second half of the book loses steam, because the
    first half is so crucial.
